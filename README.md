This is a ruby implementation of a genetic algorithm.

It comes with an example, which uses the algorithm to "evolve" a user-entered word from randomly generated strings

Step one: calibrate fitness
step two: populate
step three: evolve population:
	-pick top member
	-set them aside
	-everyone else competes
	-winners of competition breed
	-small chance of mutation

	NOTE: Though solutions can be found with this library, there seems to be a bug that may be slowing it down
